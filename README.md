A boggle solver written in go

Whenever I learn a new language, one of the first things I do is write a boggle solver.

The things solving this problem can teach you about a langue is: 

* File IO
* Data structures
* Accessing command line arguments
* How methods work
* Package management / file structure

At the time of writing this README, the boggle board is hard coded in boggle.go. The next step is to pull the letters from the command line. 

Compile, run boggle in the same directory as dictionary.txt, and you will see the number of words found on the board.
